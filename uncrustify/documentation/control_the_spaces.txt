The do_space function within the file space.cpp controls the space between every two tokens.

There are three categories of actions.
The first one is the most important.
Options control what is to do with the interval between the two token:
 *   "Ignore" means do not change it.
 *   "Add" in the context of spaces means make sure there is at least 1.
 *   "Add" elsewhere means make sure one is present.
 *   "Remove" mean remove the space/brace/newline/etc.
 *   "Force" in the context of spaces means ensure that there is exactly 1.
 *   "Force" in other contexts means the same as "add".
For example the option "sp_before_assign":
Add or remove space before assignment operator '=', '+=', etc.
in such a statement:
  a =5;

The second categorie is used for all positions where no option is coded.
The third categorie is a debug for the developer, who still have something to do.
